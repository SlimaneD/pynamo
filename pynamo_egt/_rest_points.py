"""Exact replicator rest points by support (face) enumeration.

On each face of the state space, the replicator rest-point conditions are a
small linear system: every strategy in the support earns the same payoff.
Solving these systems in exact rationals finds every rest point (including
those outside the simplex, which callers filter) and detects continua
without a general-purpose symbolic solver, so analysis cannot hang.
