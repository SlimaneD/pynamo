# Changelog

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-16

### New features

- Add one-population symmetric 2×2 games (`1Pop2S`), including phase-line portraits, equilibrium analysis, automatic arrows between equilibria, and explicit rendering of complete equilibrium continua.
- Add sampled bifurcation diagrams for parameterized symmetric 2×2 games, with customizable equilibrium branches, phase lines, regime labels, arrows, markers, and continuum colors.
- Add the four standard `1Pop2S` regimes to the example catalogue: Prisoner’s Dilemma, Hawk–Dove, coordination, and mutualism.
- Replace random default trajectories with an exact user-selected number of reproducibly spaced initial conditions obtained from recursive state-space partitions.
- Add automatic one-dimensional boundary flow to `1Pop3S` and `2Pop2S` portraits, with arrows placed halfway between consecutive edge equilibria.
- Add `1Pop2S` examples to the interactive widget and show boundary flow by default in its two-dimensional state spaces while retaining seeded random interior trajectories.

### API changes

- Rename game-class identifiers to `1Pop2S`, `1Pop3S`, `1Pop4S`, `2Pop2S`, and `3Pop2S`. Catalogue lookup continues to accept the former identifiers.
- Rename the rest-point filters to `rest_points_nash`, `rest_points_strict_nash`, and `rest_points_ess`, clarifying that they classify detected replicator rest points rather than exhaustively enumerating equilibrium families.
- Remove the former `find_nash`, `find_strict_nash`, and `find_ess` aliases.
- Make `hawk_dove` the canonical one-population example and rename the square-state-space version to `two_population_hawk_dove`.
- Set the default trajectory linewidth to 1.2.

### Corrections

- Make every `3Pop2S` coordinate represent the probability of the corresponding player’s first listed strategy.
- Derive `3Pop2S` cube-axis labels from `player_strategy_labels` when explicit axis labels are absent.
- Clarify that each `2Pop2S` payoff matrix uses its focal player’s strategies as rows and the opponent’s strategies as columns.
- Correct the two-population Hawk–Dove metadata: its interior rest point is a saddle.
- Render `1Pop2S` Nash, strict-Nash, and ESS values consistently as Boolean values.
- Return `2Pop2S` vector fields consistently as NumPy arrays.
- Prevent custom trajectory arrowheads from being clipped on square boundaries.
- Make state-space drawing respect the supplied Matplotlib axes in multi-panel figures.
- Avoid changing applications’ global warning filters when pyNamo is imported.
- Keep live widget figures active when later notebook cells switch Matplotlib backends or close pyplot-managed figures.
- Remove obsolete debug code from the four-strategy payoff calculation.

### Documentation

- Add introductory phase-line and bifurcation sections to both tutorial notebooks.
- Reorganize the tutorials around the widget, mathematical model, quick portrait, game catalog, construction examples for every supported game class, and later analysis and visualization guidance.
- Add a four-strategy game-construction example and practical guidance for viewing three-dimensional phase portraits.
- Add worked face portraits for the ownership and cyclic mismatching-pennies games, with guidance on the limits of face dynamics for understanding the three-dimensional interior.
- Document deterministic trajectory placement, automatic boundary flow, coordinate conventions, equilibrium warnings, and publication-quality figure controls.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-08

- Use Retina inline PNG previews for ordinary tutorial plots while retaining widgets for the explorer and rotatable 3D examples; SVG/PDF export quality is unaffected.
- Document occasional blank interactive 3D outputs in Binder, with advice to rerun the plotting cell or use an inline static preview.
- Introduce the `pynamo_egt` package namespace and a convenient top-level API.
- Replace standalone module imports with package imports throughout the tutorials and tests. Old imports such as `import drawer` are no longer supported.
- Keep the optional notebook widget module lazily loaded.

## 0.1.2 — 2026-09-07

- Preserve Colab’s preinstalled dependencies by installing only the core package without forced reinstallation or notebook extras.
- Fix ESS classification at boundary rest points when unused strategies tie as best responses. The test now includes all feasible tied-mutant invasion directions.
- Correctly flag all-zero games as having non-isolated replicator rest points.
- Clarify that Nash, strict Nash, and ESS classifications annotate detected replicator rest points; they do not enumerate additional static equilibria.
- Add regression tests for boundary and mixed ESS, strategy-order invariance, degenerate games, and preservation of the detected rest-point set.
- Update both tutorials with references and a streamlined ending, and clear saved outputs and execution counts.
- Synchronize package and citation metadata at version 0.1.2.
